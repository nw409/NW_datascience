Python code used to run BLASTp analysis

## Overview
This Python script retrieves a protein sequence from the NCBI database using a given protein accession number. It then allows the user to perform a BLASTp search on the retrieved sequence, returning the top 100 homologous protein sequences ordered by query cover.

## Features
- Retrieve protein sequences from NCBI using accession numbers.
- Perform BLASTp searches against the non-redundant protein database.
- Display the top 100 homologous sequences with detailed information.

## Requirements
To run this script, you need the **Biopython** library (A set of tools for biological computation).
